### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned about the `:nth-of-type()` pseudo class from Kevin Powell. This pseudo-class allows me to use one class in the child elements in my HTML file

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="article">
  <h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
</div>
<div class="article">
  <h2>Hello World</h2>
</div>
```

```css
.article:nth-of-type(2) {
  /* this is going to change the color of the text within the 2nd article class*/
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Useful resources
